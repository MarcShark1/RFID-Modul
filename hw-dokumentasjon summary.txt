2) The PCD (Proximity Coupling Device): NXP MFRC522 Contactless Reader IC
3) The PICC (short for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card): A card or tag using the ISO
14443A interface, eg Mifare or NTAG203. 


The MIFARE Classic 1K offers 1024 bytes of data storage, split into 16 sectors; each sector
is protected by two different keys, called A and B. Each key can be
programmed to allow operations such as reading, writing, increasing valueblocks,
etc. 

 Block 3 in each sector is the Sector Trailer.
 * Bytes 0-5: Key A
 * Bytes 6-8: Access Bits
 * Bytes 9: User data
 * Bytes 10-15: Key B (or user data)
